import nltk

'''
The code uses the NLTK library for stopwords and stemmer, so make sure to have nltk installed 
and download the stopwords before running the code. Here, the stopwords have been downloaded in English. 
Please note that this is just an example and you may need to run nltk.download() function for other languages or corpora as well.
It's also worth noting that, there are other libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and gensim that offer stopwords in many languages. 
You can use any of them, depending on your preference or the specific requirements of your project.
